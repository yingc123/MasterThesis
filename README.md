# Binary Mask Generation in 3D+T Microscopy Images using Convolutional Neural Networks and Temporal Smoothness Constraints



We proposed a method combining convolution neural network and spatiotemporal smoothing techniques used for semantic segmentation of the 4D Drosophila and Arabidopsis embryos datasets. The method, 3D U-net +STP, segments the background from the foreground regions for a temporal sequence of volumetric images, it can automatically analyze large scale datasets and replace the currently manually performed masking steps. Furthermore, the generated masks of 3D U-net +STP are smoothly changing in both the spatial and temporal domains.
